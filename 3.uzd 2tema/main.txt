According to traditional thinking, procrastinators ( people who delay or put things off ) have a time management problem. Increasingly, however, psychologists are realising that the issue is more complicated. Experts at Carleton University have proposed that procrastination is an issue with managing our emotions, not our time. The task we are putting off is making us feel bad – perhaps it is boring, too difficult or we are worried about failing – and to make ourselves feel better in the moment, we start doing something else, like watching videos.
